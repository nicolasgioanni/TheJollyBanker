Program 5: The Jolly Banker
By: Krisna Oeurn, Samar Malla, and Sandesh Rai, Nicolas Gioanni

In this project, we created a banking system that takes in lines of string transactions into a memory queue and processes it.
We then connect it to a Account/Fund class that is being associated with these transactions based off a Binary Search Tree which will
store and manage the accounts.
